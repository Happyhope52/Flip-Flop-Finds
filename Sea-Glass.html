  <h1> I Want To Age Like Sea Glass</h1>
<br>
  <br>
  <p class="seaglasswords"> I want to age like sea glass. Smoothed by tides, not broken.
  <br><br>I want the currents of life to toss me around, shake me up and leave me feeling washed clean. 
   <br><br>
   I want my hard edges to soften as the years pass — made not weak, but supple. 
   <br><br>
   I want to ride the waves, go with the flow, feel the impact of the surging tides rolling in and out.
   <br><br>
  When I am thrown against the shore and caught between the rocks and a hard place, I want to rest there until I can find the strength to do what is next. 
  <br><br>
  Not stuck — just waiting, pondering, feeling what it feels like to pause.
  <br><br>
   And when I am ready, I will catch a wave and let it carry me along to the next place that I am supposed to be.
   <br><br>
  I want to be picked up on occasion by an unsuspected soul and carried along — just for the connection, just for the sake of appreciation and wonder. 
  <br><br>
  And with each encounter, new possibilities of collaboration are presented, and new ideas are born.
  <br><br>
  I want to age like sea glass so that when people see the old woman I'll become, they'll embrace all that I am.
  <br><br>
 They'll marvel at my exquisite nature, hold me gently in their hands and be awed by my well-earned patina. 
 <br><br>
 Neither flashy nor dull, just the right luster. And they'll wonder, if just for a second, what it is exactly I am made of and how I got to be in this very here and now. 
 <br><br>
 And we'll both feel lucky to realize, once again, that we have landed in that perfectly right place at that profoundly right time.
 <br><br>
  I want to age like sea glass. I want to enjoy the journey and let my preciousness be, not in spite of the impacts of life, but because of them.
