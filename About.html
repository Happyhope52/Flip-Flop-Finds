    <h1>Flip Flop Finds</h1>
<br>
<br>

<p>Flip Flop Finds was born out of Covid. Lucky enough to live minutes away from the beautiful North Essex coastline,
   whenever it was legally possible we would escape to the vastness of Frinton Beach or the 'secret waters' of Hamford Water
   and The Twizzle - the setting for Swallows and Amazons.</p>
   <br>
   <p>During our walks we took to beach-combing and were fascinated with our finds. The tiny fragments of seaglass twinkling
   in the dazzling sun, the unusual pieces of pottery with its mysterious history, the variety and numbers of sea shells washed up on the shore - and the delight 
   of finding an architectually shaped piece of driftwood had us mesmerised for hours.</p>
<br>
   <p>Pretty soon our finds, after a bit of art and craft work, became gifts for family and friends - who encouraged us to 
   sell online.......so here we are.</p>
<br>
   <p>We hope you enjoy walking around our site. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or would like
   to talk to us further.
   <br>
   <br>
    Lots of Love,</p>
<br>
